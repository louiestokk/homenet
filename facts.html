          What are the rules about owning land or houses in Zanzibar as a
          foreigner?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Through ZIPA, which is the department for leasing houses or land in
          Zanzibar, foreigners can lease land or houses for up to 99 years.
          Foreigners have the right to start a business in Zanzibar and the
          company itself can own a house or land directly in Zanzibar. So these
          2 options are what apply to foreign. We at Zanzihome.com can help you
          with the whole process, which can take between 1-3 weeks.
